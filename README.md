# Hand Angle Detection for a project to do using Raspberry pie
## Overview
This project uses a webcam and the Raspberry Pi to detect the angle between the hand and the center of the camera frame. By using the MediaPipe library, it identifies the position of the hand landmarks and calculates the angle based on the index finger's position. This angle can be useful for applications such as controlling motors, robotics, or gesture-based interfaces.

The project uses the **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** libraries for computer vision and hand landmark detection.
